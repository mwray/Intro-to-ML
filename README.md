# Intro-to-ML

If you know how to use Python, get started on the jupyter notebook.

You can start this with:

`jupyter lab` in the command line.


If not, go to the intro to python notebook [here](https://github.com/COMSM0045-Applied-Deep-Learning/labsheets/tree/master/lab-0-python-intro).

You should be able to clone the repo and then work your way through lab 0.

You can read through these until you finish 2-jupyter.ipynb, then you can start jupyter in the same way:

`jupyter lab`


If you have any issues, let me know!
